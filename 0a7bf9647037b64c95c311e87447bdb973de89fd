For some reason the paramiko code doesn\u0027t like the key in that case.\nAs this is a workaround for the testing environment due to limitations in paramiko, and that newer version of ansible use the cryptography library by default which may also solve the issue, I\u0027d decided to just use ssh-keygen directly.",
