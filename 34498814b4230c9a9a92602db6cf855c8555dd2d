      "message": "Seems to me that for RGW at least in 17 tempest defaults work - just plain commenting out this key/value in tempest.conf lets test_container_acl_negative tests pass. So we should not apply this there. To my knowledge we do not have failures in 16 - but we likely go with defaults which means swift - so if this should be applied to 16 it would need better condition (detect rgw?).",
